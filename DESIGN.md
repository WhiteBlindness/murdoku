# Design System: Alibi

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Continuity Desk"**

Alibi is a working 1940s film-editing continuity desk translated into a modern deduction interface. Magnetic graphite holds the workspace together; bone evidence strips, contact-sheet portraits, clipped tabs, film perforations, and restrained projector amber make the player's reasoning feel assembled by hand. It is cinematic without becoming a poster: the board, clues, tools, and accusation remain unmistakably operative.

The chrome and the solving environment intentionally use different materials. The surrounding interface is dark, archival, and controlled, while the board is a real 3D dollhouse built from Kenney's Furniture Kit models (three.js, fixed orthographic camera at 45°/32°): one continuous floor slab, a full-height north/west shell with night windows and a front door, cut-down interior partitions with real door frames, and furniture placed against walls and on surfaces by measured geometry. The logical grid stays hidden until interaction requires it. See docs/ISOMETRIC_SCENE_SYSTEM.md. Paper is reserved for evidence-bearing objects, never spread across the whole application as a parchment dashboard.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Magnetic graphite and smoky-olive chrome in dark mode; a daylight editing bench in light mode.
- Fixed bone paper for evidence, continuity frames, and case files.
- One projector-amber chain linking the selected frame, clue, and literal board target.
- Condensed industrial headlines, typewritten evidence, and neutral compact controls.
- Sharp rectangles, clipped corners, torn edges, perforations, and contact-sheet crops.
- A dominant isometric detective dollhouse rendered from Kenney's 3D models, authored as architecture (walls, doors, surfaces) over a hidden Murdoku grid.

## Colors

The palette separates theme-aware desk chrome from fixed physical evidence and board materials: semantic chrome flips between night and daylight, while paper and illustrated floors retain their object identity.

### Primary

- **Projector Amber** (`colors.projector-amber`): active tools, the accusation action, selected continuity states, timer readouts, and the clue-to-board trace.
- **Projector Focus** (`colors.projector-focus`): the solid keyboard focus outline and the precise active target edge; never substitute a translucent glow.
- **Ink on Amber** (`colors.ink-on-amber`): text and icons placed directly on amber fills.

### Secondary

- **Bone Evidence** (`colors.bone-evidence`): archival-paper case cards and the continuity strip. It remains a material color across themes rather than becoming page chrome.

### Tertiary

- **Oxblood Conflict** (`colors.oxblood`): row/column conflicts, destructive confirmation, victim and rejection states only.
- **Danger Copy** (`colors.danger-copy`): accessible conflict and destructive-state text against the current desk theme.

### Neutral

- **Magnetic Ground** (`colors.background-base`): the full-bleed graphite desk or daylight bench.
- **Instrument Surface** (`colors.background-surface`): panels, command controls, notes, and bounded support regions.
- **Selected Plate** (`colors.background-elevated`): committed or selected dark-chrome states.
- **Film Gate** (`colors.background-inset`): recessed inputs, command rails, and deep framing.
- **Bone, Evidence, and Metadata Copy** (`colors.text-primary`, `colors.text-secondary`, `colors.text-muted`): the three-level chrome hierarchy.
- **Strong Edge** (`colors.border-strong`): every outline that must communicate an interactive boundary.
- **Subtle Hairline** (`colors.border-subtle`): decorative dividers only.
- **Evidence Ink** (`colors.evidence-ink`): fixed near-black copy on bone paper.
- **Espresso Divider** (`colors.board-wall`): the heavy near-black frame and room boundaries, printed like the rules of a physical board, that organize the mansion without overpowering its materials.
- **Espresso Illustration Ink** (`colors.miniature-contour`, `colors.miniature-contour-deep`): the 2.4–3.2px outer silhouette and directional shadow on board miniatures; never substitute pure black.
- **Mahogany Seam and Muted Brass** (`colors.miniature-seam`, `colors.miniature-highlight`): fine construction detail, hardware, paper edges, and selective highlights inside the stronger silhouette.
- **Evidence Amber and Danger Ink** (`colors.evidence-amber-ink`, `colors.evidence-danger-ink`): the placed-count readout and the conflict state printed on the parchment continuity strip.
- **Step Numerals** (`colors.step-numeral`, `colors.step-numeral-selected`): the sequence numbers on the continuity strip's dark and amber chips.
- **Board Vignette and Key Light** (`colors.board-vignette`, `colors.board-keylight`): the two-layer lighting wash over the reconstruction board.

### Named Rules

**The Amber Evidence Rule.** Projector amber marks the current reasoning path and primary commitment; it is not ambient decoration.

**The Oxblood Exception Rule.** Oxblood is reserved for danger, conflict, victim, destructive confirmation, and rejection.

**The Strong Edge Rule.** A border that is the only visible affordance must use the strong tier; the subtle tier may divide content but never carry interaction alone.

**The Fixed Material Rule.** Anything printed on a physical surface — parchment evidence, the continuity strip, the board and its lighting — keeps a fixed literal colour and does not follow the theme. Parchment is parchment in both themes, so ink that flipped with the theme would go bone-on-bone and vanish in daylight. These values are listed as tokens above precisely so they read as decisions rather than as stray hex; do not "helpfully" convert them to `var(--color-*)`.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Barlow Condensed (with a system sans-serif fallback)

**Body/Evidence Font:** Courier Prime (with a system monospace fallback)

**UI Font:** Hanken Grotesk (with a system sans-serif fallback)

**Character:** Barlow Condensed supplies taut industrial headlines, Courier Prime makes clues and measurements read as recorded evidence, and Hanken Grotesk keeps dense utility chrome legible. The pairing is narrow and technical, never distressed or novelty-noir.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (700, `typography.display`): the ALIBI masthead only; condensed, immediate, and tightly tracked.
- **Headline** (700, `typography.headline`): case titles and evidence subjects, usually uppercase.
- **Action** (600, `typography.action`): tool and command labels with moderate tracking.
- **Evidence** (400, `typography.evidence`): clues, notes, timers, counts, and explanatory copy.
- **Technical Label** (400, `typography.technical-label`): compact uppercase metadata at 10px with wide tracking; use only where the nearby value or section content carries the meaning. 10px is the floor — the previous "9–10px" wording is what let a second, undocumented step accumulate across the app.
- **UI** (600, `typography.ui`): compact search, resume, and secondary control copy where monospace would become noisy.
- **Subject** (700, `typography.subject`): suspect names and primary button labels — the smallest size Barlow is allowed to name something at.
- **Copy** (400, `typography.copy`): the case-notes field and any evidence paragraph that has to be read rather than scanned.
- **Headline Wide** (700, `typography.headline-wide`): the case masthead title once there is room for it; `subject` is its narrow-screen step.
- **Panel Title** (700, `typography.panel-title`): panel, rail, and modal headings.
- **Section** (700, `typography.section`): screen-level section titles and large monospace readouts.
- **Verdict** (700, `typography.verdict`): the CASE CLOSED stamp. One element, deliberately its own step.
- **Reveal** (700, `typography.reveal`): the murderer's name on the victory screen, and the headline stat readouts beside it.

### Named Rules

**The Three Voices Rule.** Barlow names the subject, Courier records the evidence, and Hanken operates the chrome; do not swap their jobs.

**The Closed Ramp Rule.** The thirteen steps above are the whole type scale: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24, 30, and the display clamp. Every size shipping in the app maps to one of them, whether it is written as an arbitrary value, an inline style, or a Tailwind step. A size that does not appear here is drift, not a decision — add a named role with a stated job, or use the nearest existing one. This ramp was reconciled against the running app rather than asserted: before reconciliation the document described five steps while the components rendered eleven, so the automated check could only police how a size was written, never whether it was on the scale.

## Layout

The solving surface is a reconstruction sequence, not a dashboard. A compact 64px masthead leads into a full-width horizontal continuity strip, followed by the dominant square board and a 340–420px dossier column at large screens (1024px and above). The board remains square by sizing from the shorter available axis; the dossier scrolls independently while its accusation control remains outside the scroll region.

Below 1024px the screen becomes one natural document flow: masthead → board → horizontally scrollable continuity strip → suspect clues → notes → tools → accusation. At 640–1023px, suspect evidence may use two columns; on smaller phones it returns to one. Interactive targets remain at least 44px and no sticky region may cover a cell or clue.

The home index uses a full-bleed desk with a centered 1600px maximum content width, page gutters of 16px, 24px, and 40px across the responsive range, and a case grid that progresses from one to two, three, then six columns. The base spacing rhythm is 4px, with 8px control gaps, 12px panel density, and 16px roomier panel padding.

**The Board-First Rule.** On narrow screens, the board precedes evidence, tools, and accusation because spatial reading starts the solving loop.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is physical and directional: raster graphite on the surrounding desk, archival paper, cut inset edges, and restrained lifted evidence. The dollhouse is lit by one warm key light with a shadow map and one hemisphere fill; contact and cast shadows come from the geometry, never from per-object settings. Laptops, lamps, books and appliances sit on a declared parent surface at its measured height. The system is flat by default and adds shadow only when an object behaves like paper above steel, a miniature on the floor, a selected projector field, or a focused control. Hover lift is limited to fine pointers; reduced motion collapses transitions and animations.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **Cut Edge** (`var(--shadow-cut)`): an inset top highlight and lower shadow that gives panels and paper a physical edge.
- **Evidence Lift** (`var(--shadow-elevated)`): a deep, blurred directional shadow for elevated or hovered evidence.
- **Projector Field** (`var(--projector-glow)`): an amber light bloom around the active reasoning area, never used as the sole focus indicator.
- **Accessible Focus** (`var(--focus-ring)`): a two-stage base-and-amber ring paired with a solid 2px outline and 3px offset.

### Named Rules

**The Directional Depth Rule.** Every shadow must describe paper, steel, or projector light; generic ambient card shadows do not belong on the desk.

## Shapes

The default form is a sharp rectangle. Evidence frames use clipped 6–10px corners, arrow-notched continuity steps, irregular torn strip edges, square numbered magnets, and heavy espresso room dividers. Micro-rounding is limited to tiny overlays, miniature upholstery and fixtures, and suspect tokens where a 2–6px radius protects legibility at small sizes; it is never promoted into rounded card language.

**The Clipped, Not Rounded Rule.** Use clipping, not pills or generous radii, to create tactile silhouettes.

## Components

### Masthead Navigation

- **Character:** a compact instrument bar, not a marketing header.
- **Shape:** full-width, square, 64px minimum height with subtle internal dividers.
- **States:** 44px back, timer, and help targets; muted copy brightens on hover and receives the shared focus ring.

### Buttons

- **Primary:** full-width projector amber, ink-on-amber copy, square corners, 16px vertical padding, and condensed uppercase type. The accusation button is always reachable below the dossier scroller.
- **Tool:** a 44px minimum outlined control on the instrument surface. Active mode uses an amber wash and solid amber edge; an engaged non-mode action uses a dashed amber edge so it cannot be mistaken for the selected tool.
- **Filter:** a 44px square clipped-corner control. Selection changes fill, text, and border together rather than relying on color alone.
- **Hover / Focus:** hover color changes are limited to fine pointers where practical; focus uses the solid projector-focus outline and the two-stage focus ring.

### Cards / Containers

- **Case File:** fixed bone paper with evidence texture, torn strip silhouette, strong edge, and restrained directional lift.
- **Continuity Frame:** an ordered 52px minimum button with a right-pointing clipped tab, square magnetic number, name, and text state. The horizontal sequence may scroll; it never compresses below readable identity on phones.
- **Suspect Evidence:** bone paper strip with a contact-sheet portrait, industrial uppercase name, typewritten clue, and optional 44px resolution box. Selection warms the paper and uses the suspect accent as a precise edge.
- **Evidence Panel:** theme-aware instrument surface with a strong border and cut inset edge; use for search, notes, and support content.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Search:** 44px high recessed field with a left search icon, strong boundary, and Courier Prime input text.
- **Case Notes:** a resizeable inset textarea with 12px internal padding, visible focus-border shift, local-save status, and an explicit destructive-confirmation step before clearing.

### Illustrated Reconstruction Board

Each case is an authored 3D scene laid over the unchanged logical board (Midnight Delivery is the golden master). Architecture comes first: a continuous north/west shell with windows and the front door, south/east walls cut to a plinth, cut-down partitions with door frames, pony walls where furniture must back onto the camera side. The floor is one slab; grass, tile and stone zones and Kenney rugs are interior accents, never logical room boundaries.

Every logical furnishing keeps an explicit `logic` association with a visual object that touches its cells; models render at Kenney's real size (there is no per-object scale). Small props declare a supporting surface. At rest there are no cell markers, row bands, column bands or room labels. Placement mode reveals tiny floor cues. Active and completed rows and columns use floor washes painted on the floor (occluded by furniture), thin dashed traces and small endpoints; they never outline every cell.

### Named Rules

**The Hidden Logic Rule.** A stranger who sees the idle environment should describe a miniature apartment, not a grid. The Murdoku topology appears only as solving feedback and never dictates the architectural rhythm.

**The Asked-For Help Rule.** The board answers a clue with an amber square around its actual target cells, and only when the player presses that suspect's locate control. Help is requested, never volunteered: selecting a suspect is a placement action and must not light the board. There is deliberately no drawn clue-to-board connector — a line between two independently sized layout regions can only be positioned by guessed percentages, and it pointed into empty space at every viewport it was not tuned on.

**The Kenney World Rule.** Kenney's 3D models define the visual world at their real size and grounding. Objects are placed by relationship — against a wall face, on a surface, at a point — never by pixel offset, lift or scale.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** keep theme-aware chrome and fixed evidence/board materials as separate layers.
- **Do** keep paper on evidence-bearing objects and steel/graphite on application chrome.
- **Do** preserve a continuous apartment shell, clear doorways, believable circulation and furniture relationships.
- **Do** keep logical furniture associations explicit while allowing independent visual placement.
- **Do** keep room names accessible without painting them permanently on the floor.
- **Do** use real buttons, 44px targets, visible focus, keyboard board navigation, and reduced-motion fallbacks.
- **Do** keep avatar use to the active dossier; use inexpensive accent markers in the case catalog.
- **Do** test both themes at phone and desktop widths with the board, clues, and accusation all visible and legible.

### Don't:

- **Don't** turn the interface into a generic rounded-card dashboard, glass surface, neon cyberpunk scene, or full-screen parchment tableau.
- **Don't** use projector amber for passive decoration or oxblood for ordinary emphasis.
- **Don't** build walls from puzzle-cell boundaries or repeat short panels into a maze, staircase or office-cubicle plan.
- **Don't** place props on the floor when they require a desk, table, shelf or counter.
- **Don't** expose a permanent grid, placement circles or saturated row and column bands.
- **Don't** use the translucent board glow as a focus ring or the subtle border as an interactive boundary.
- **Don't** load every suspect portrait in the home catalog.
- **Don't** remount the accusation button to replay rejection motion; preserve focus and restart the CSS animation in place.
