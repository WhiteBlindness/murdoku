// ============================================================================
// EVALUATION BRANCH ONLY — Kenney Furniture Kit (CC0) swapped in for the
// hand-drawn noire miniatures, so the two directions can be compared on the
// real board instead of argued about.
//
// Kenney's kit ships every object in four pre-rendered facings
// (NE/NW/SE/SW), which is the one thing it does better than hand-drawn art
// here: a turned piece never has to be rotated by CSS, because the turned
// view already exists. SE is used face-on and SW as the side view, feeding
// the FURNITURE_ICON_SIDE mechanism already in the renderer.
//
// KNOWN GAP: the kit has no clock, which is one of the game's 19 types and
// is referenced by clue text ("Beside the clock"). `radio` stands in for it
// here so the board renders; it would need resolving before this could ship.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * A sprite is shown WHOLE and UNRETOUCHED. That sounds obvious; the first
 * attempt did neither, and it is what ruined the art.
 *
 * What went wrong, so it is not repeated:
 *   - the sprite was boxed at 94% of a cell and given `object-fit: contain`.
 *     An isometric object is much taller than its floor footprint, so
 *     `contain` solved for the HEIGHT and shrank the whole piece until its
 *     base covered a fraction of the square it was standing on. Everything
 *     read as a doll's-house miniature dropped in the middle of a big tile.
 *   - a drop-shadow was added on top of art that already carries its own
 *     baked contact shadow, doubling it into a smudge.
 *   - the vertical lift (scaleY) then stretched the result out of proportion.
 *
 * The fix is to stop treating the sprite as an icon in a box. It is bottom
 * anchored and drawn WIDER than its cell, so its floor footprint fills the
 * square and its height is free to rise out of the top — which is how the
 * object was rendered in the first place. `object-fit` is deliberately absent:
 * the image keeps its intrinsic aspect and nothing is cropped or letterboxed.
